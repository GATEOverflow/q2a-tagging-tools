TAG SYNONYMS
Question2Answer plugin
-------------------------------------------------

This is an event plugin for popular open source Q&A platform, Question2Answer <question2answer.org>. It allows you to select 'tag synonyms' - unwanted or duplicate tags that should be changed or removed.

For example if you had 'websites' as a tag, some questions may also get tagged 'website'. With this plugin you can set 'website' to always be changed to 'websites' when a user enters it.



INSTALLATION & USAGE
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to a subfolder such as `tag-synonyms` inside the `qa-plugins` folder of your Q2A installation.
2. Log in to your Q2A site as a Super Administrator and head to Admin > Plugins.
3. Under "Tag Synonyms", enter each pair of tags on a new line, separated by a comma. For example, `q2a,question2answer` (without quotes) means that a tag of `q2a` will be replaced by `question2answer`, while `help` on its own line means that tag will be removed.
4. Click the button to save changes. All future questions will replace your chosen tag synonyms.
5. If you have existing mistagged questions, tick the checkbox to replace all tags in older questions with your synonyms.

WARNING: if you have a lot of questions on your site, converting all the old questions WILL TAKE A LONG TIME. It's recommended that you add tag synonyms one or two at a time to avoid overhead.
